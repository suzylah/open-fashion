The Openwear project started as a collaborative European project in 2010, aiming to optimize the ability of small producers to compete in the marketplace through collaboration and networking. 

<!--more--> 

This vision is described in the OpenWear license: *OpenWear is an open brand … a type of collective trademark that recognizes the productive role of co-production, engages in strategies that aim at redistributing the values thus produced, and seeks organizational solutions that give co-producers a say in determining the overall governance of the brand [as well as] the overall social values toward which the brand should contribute.*

The OpenWear project is an experiment with two key objectives. First, it attempts to define a new type of worker, occupying a middle ground between fashion designer and crafter-artisan. We use the term “network artisan,” meaning a worker who is a maker but also capable of setting up a small business. Second, our experiment involves open-sourcing the brand and distributing the manufacturing process. Our aim is to make social goals primary and business a means of achieving those goals.

Three shared resources formed the core of OpenWear’s activities. The first was an online platform (no longer available) where designers and makers could present their personal or collaborative work and connect with others. 

The second resource is a series of prototype collections: garments plus plans and instructions for producing them, all created collaboratively and in response to a brief that our group provides. The result is a common resource for members of the online community, who can download the patterns and instructions for free. Members can then produce the garments as presented or modify them, changing the patterns and re-sharing these with the community. They can also sell finished garments directly on the platform, with the community receiving a percentage of the profits.

The third resource is the metabrand. Every item of the collection can be trademarked with the logo as well as with members’ personal brands, if any. This enables individual members, while remaining part of the community, to create unique garments and lines, for example by choosing inexpensive or luxurious fabrics depending on their own resources, tastes, or customer base.
