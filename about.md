## About this site

This site is a collection of open source fashion resources. It presents a mix of past collaborations and own project, and resources collected during the years working with open approaches and open source philosophy in fashion, textiles & crafts. The project is available as a public repository on GitHub, where it is also hosted. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code and by programmers.

Contributions are welcome!
